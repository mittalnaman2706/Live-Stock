# Live-Stock

The Web App(In Development Phase) would do the Following:
* I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
* I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
* I can remove stocks.
* I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock (Users refer to the users accessing the website on same LAN).
